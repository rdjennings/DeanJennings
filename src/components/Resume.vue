				The downloadable resume that I had here (a pdf) was getting a bit dated.  I have not posted a new version in quite a while.
				<br /><br />
				So, the orginal/editable version is on a server here that is offline.  Once I bring it back online I'll update it and present
				an HTML version as well as a downloadable Word and pdf versions for your reading pleasure.
